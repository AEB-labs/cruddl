# make sure that counting edges does not include dangling edges
# obviously, there should be no dangling edges because we should delete them properly, but this test is probably still
# a good idea
# TODO this does not actually test if dangling edges are filtered because deleteDelivery deletes the edges
# if we want to test that, we need an test-data.ts that uses AQL directly
