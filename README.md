**cruddl** - create a cuddly GraphQL API for your database, using the GraphQL SDL to model your schema.

This TypeScript library creates an executable GraphQL schema from a model definition and provides queries and mutations
to access a database. Currently, it supports the multi-model database [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/). The concept
being inspired by existing projects like [prisma](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma) and
[join-monster](https://github.com/stems/join-monster), cruddl exploits the expressiveness of the Arango Query Language
(AQL) to generate one tailored query for each GraphQL request.

## Features

-   Schema definition using GraphQL types, fields and directives
-   Modelling features like relations, embedded lists and objects
-   Query features include filtering, sorting, cursor-based pagination and arbitrary nesting
-   Schema validation
-   Role-based authorization (field and type-based; static and data-dependent)
-   Pluggable database backends (currently supports ArangoDB and an in-memory implementation)

## Usage

```
npm install --save cruddl
```

Install [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) and create a new database.

```typescript
import { ArangoDBAdapter } from 'cruddl';
const db = new ArangoDBAdapter({
    databaseName: 'databaseName',
    url: 'http://root:@localhost:8529',
    user: 'root',
    password: '',
});
```

If you just want to explore the features, you can also use an in-memory database implementation - but don't use this for
anything else.

```typescript
import { InMemoryAdapter } from 'cruddl';
const db = new InMemoryAdapter();
```

Define your data model and create a project:

```typescript
import { Project } from 'cruddl';
const project = new Project({
    sources: [
        {
            name: 'schema.graphqls',
            body: `
            type Movie @rootEntity {
              title: String
              actors: Actor @relation
            }
            
            type Actor @rootEntity {
              name: String
              movies: Movie @relation(inverseOf: "actors")
            }`,
        },
        {
            name: 'permission-profiles.json',
            body: JSON.stringify({
                permissionProfiles: {
                    default: {
                        permissions: [
                            {
                                roles: ['users'],
                                access: 'readWrite',
                            },
                        ],
                    },
                },
            }),
        },
    ],
    getExecutionOptions: ({ context }) => ({ authContext: { authRoles: ['users'] } }),
    getOperationIdentifier: ({ context }) => context as object, // each operation is executed with an unique context object
});
```

Then, create the GraphQL schema and serve it:

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';
const schema = project.createSchema(db);
db.updateSchema(project.getModel()); // create missing collections
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    context: ({ req }) => req, // pass request as context so we have a unique context object for each operation
});
server.listen(4000, () => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/'));
```

See the [modelling guide](docs/modelling.md) and the [api documentation](docs/api.md) for details.

### Usage in a browser environment

The core of cruddl perfectly works in a browser (e.g., using webpack), and this can be useful to generate a mock GraphQL
schema on the fly or to validate a cruddl project. However, the ArangoDB adapter only works with node imports like
`path`. Unless you configure webpack to provide mock modules for them, you will get an error when you import `cruddl` in
a webpack environment. To solve this, you can import the core symbols from `cruddl/core` and the `InMemoryAdapter` from
`cruddl/inmemory`.

## Running Tests

For consistency, tests shall be run against a single arangodb node:

1. npm i
2. npm run start_arangodb
3. ensure you have access to console at http://localhost:8529
4. npm run test

When done, stop the instance with `npm run stop_arangodb`
